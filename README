pirem.sh
========

pirem.sh is a wrapper script to pull data out of a google calendar and distribute
the data this by twitter, mail and wiki-entries.

It uses a slightly modded version of gcalcli for the pulling part,
ttytter to send tweets, /bin/mail to send mail and lynx to poke a wikibot.


gcalcli-pirem
=============

In order to avoid conflicts with the official gcalcli
(see https://code.google.com/p/gcalcli/ ), I keep a renamed copy here.

The only modification so far is that my version acceptis the option '--skript'
and the "agenda" command produces tab-seperated output if this option is given.

The modifications to gcalcli-2.1 were mostly done through try and error.
I've never written any python before that.  It's working,
but it's surely not as elegant as it could be.


TODO
====

- I need to put some information on the wikibot in here.
- Strip everything unneeded from gcalcli-pirem
- Enhance _SkriptFriendly. Pretty Please?
